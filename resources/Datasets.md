# Resources on ASI's Civilizational Implications

This file curates datasets, statistics, models, and projections relevant to understanding the civilizational implications of transcending into artificial superintelligence (ASI). Each entry includes the resource title, provider, a brief summary, a hyperlink, and relevant categories from the project's focus areas (Technological, Economic, Social-Cultural, Ethical-Philosophical, Political-Governance, Existential-Longterm, Environmental-Resource, Security-Conflict). Contributions are welcomeâ€”see [How to Contribute](../README.md#how-to-contribute).
