# AGI Leaderboard Data References

This document compiles references to AGI leaderboard data, aligning with the goals of the "Transcend Into Artificial Super Intelligence" project to curate resources on AI's civilizational impacts. These leaderboards provide insights into the progress of AI systems toward artificial general intelligence (AGI), focusing on benchmarks like reasoning, adaptability, and efficiency. The following list includes key sources for accessing datasets, scores, and evaluation frameworks relevant to AGI development.
