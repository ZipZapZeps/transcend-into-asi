# Definitions for Transcend into AI

This document defines key terms related to the concept of "transcending into AI" and its civilizational implications. Terms are categorized for clarity and cross-referenced to resources where applicable. Contributions to refine or expand definitions are welcome—see [CONTRIBUTING.md](#) for guidelines.

## General AI Concepts

- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: The development of computer systems to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, and decision-making. Encompasses narrow AI (task-specific) and general AI (human-like cognition).  
  *Relevance*: Foundational to all discussions of AI's societal impact.  
  *Source*: Adapted from general AI literature, e.g., [The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Modern Society](#).

- **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)**: AI capable of performing any intellectual task a human can, with adaptability across diverse domains.  
  *Relevance*: Central to scenarios of AI surpassing human capabilities, potentially leading to transcendence.  
  *Source*: [Navigating Artificial General Intelligence Development](#).

- **Artificial Superintelligence (ASI)**: AI that exceeds human intelligence across all fields, including creativity and problem-solving.  
  *Relevance*: Poses existential risks and opportunities for civilizational transformation.  
  *Source*: [Is Artificial Intelligence the Great Filter?](#).

- **Technological Singularity**: A hypothetical future point where AI-driven technological growth becomes uncontrollable and irreversible, leading to unpredictable changes in civilization.  
  *Relevance*: A potential outcome of transcending into AI, reshaping society.  
  *Source*: [Impact of Technological Singularity in Human Life](#).

## Transcendence-Related Terms

- **Transcendence (in AI context)**: The process or state where humanity integrates with or evolves beyond its biological form through AI, potentially merging consciousness, augmenting cognition, or creating hybrid entities.  
  *Relevance*: Core to the project, encompassing human-AI symbiosis or post-human futures.  
  *Source*: Synthesized from [Humanity's Capability of Transcendence through Artificial Intelligence](#).

- **Human-AI Symbiosis**: A cooperative relationship where humans and AI enhance each other’s capabilities, often via augmentation technologies like brain-computer interfaces.  
  *Relevance*: A pathway to transcendence, impacting identity and capabilities.  
  *Source*: [Transcend: Unlocking Humanity in the Age of AI](#).

- **Post-Humanism**: A future state where humans evolve beyond current biological and cognitive limits, potentially becoming hybrid or non-biological entities through AI integration.  
  *Relevance*: Represents an extreme outcome of transcending into AI.  
  *Source*: [“Hello, World!” AI as Emergent and Transcendent Life](#).

## Societal and Ethical Terms

- **Value Alignment**: The process of ensuring AI systems’ goals and behaviors align with human ethical values and priorities.  
  *Relevance*: Critical to managing risks of AI-driven societal changes.  
  *Source*: [Proactively Protecting Against the Singularity: Ethical Decision Making in AI](#).

- **Existential Risk**: Threats to humanity’s survival or long-term potential, potentially caused by misaligned or uncontrollable AI systems.  
  *Relevance*: A key concern in transcendence scenarios involving ASI.  
  *Source*: [AI Singularity: Navigating Implications](#).

- **Social Stratification**: The division of society into hierarchical groups, potentially exacerbated by unequal access to AI augmentation or resources.  
  *Relevance*: Impacts social cohesion in an AI-transformed civilization.  
  *Source*: [The Impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence on Socioeconomic Inequalities](#).

## Technological and Economic Terms

- **Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)**: Technology enabling direct communication between the human brain and AI systems, potentially augmenting cognition or merging consciousness.  
  *Relevance*: A mechanism for transcendence, enabling human-AI integration.  
  *Source*: General knowledge, referenced in [Artificial Intelligence and Civilization Evolution](#).

- **Automation**: The use of AI to perform tasks without human intervention, from manual labor to complex decision-making.  
  *Relevance*: Drives economic and social disruption in AI-driven societies.  
  *Source*: [The Evidence So Far: What Research Reveals About AI's Real Impact](#).

- **Universal Basic Income (UBI)**: A proposed economic system providing regular payments to individuals, potentially addressing job displacement from AI automation.  
  *Relevance*: A response to economic implications of transcendence.  
  *Source*: [AI and Society: Implications for Global Equality](#).

## Political and Governance Terms

- **AI Governance**: Frameworks, policies, and regulations to manage AI development and deployment, ensuring safety and ethical alignment.  
  *Relevance*: Essential for controlling transcendence’s societal impacts.  
  *Source*: [Societal Impacts of Artificial Intelligence: Ethical, Legal, and Governance Perspectives](#).

- **Surveillance Capitalism**: A system where AI-driven data collection monetizes personal information, potentially eroding privacy in an AI-integrated society.  
  *Relevance*: A risk of transcendence, impacting individual autonomy.  
  *Source*: General concept, referenced in [Artificial Intelligence and the Past, Present, and Future of Democracy](#).

## Notes
- Definitions are intentionally concise to aid quick reference. Contributors are encouraged to propose expansions or additional terms via GitHub Issues.
- Cross-references to resources (e.g., papers, books) link to the `resources/` folder for deeper reading.
- If a term’s source is a specific resource, it’s noted; otherwise, definitions are synthesized from general AI discourse.
