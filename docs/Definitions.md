## General AI Concepts

- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: The development of computer systems to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, and decision-making. Encompasses narrow AI (task-specific) and general AI (human-like cognition).  
  *Relevance*: Foundational to all discussions of AI's societal impact.  
  *Source*: Adapted from general AI literature, e.g., [What Is The Impact Of Artificial Intelligence (AI) On Society?](https://bernardmarr.com/what-is-the-impact-of-artificial-intelligence-ai-on-society/).

- **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)**: AI capable of performing any intellectual task a human can, with adaptability across diverse domains.  
  *Relevance*: Central to scenarios of AI surpassing human capabilities, potentially leading to transcendence.  
  *Source*: [Navigating Artificial General Intelligence Development](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-92190-7).

- **Artificial Superintelligence (ASI)**: AI that exceeds human intelligence across all fields, including creativity and problem-solving.  
  *Relevance*: Poses existential risks and opportunities for civilizational transformation.  
  *Source*: [Is Artificial Intelligence the great filter that makes advanced technical civilisations rare in the universe?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00042).

- **Technological Singularity**: A hypothetical future point where AI-driven technological growth becomes uncontrollable and irreversible, leading to unpredictable changes in civilization.  
  *Relevance*: A potential outcome of transcending into AI, reshaping society.  
  *Source*: [Impact of Technological Singularity in Human Life](https://www.iosrjournals.org/iosr-jce/papers/Conf.17025-2017/Volume-2/2.%2006-09.pdf).

## Transcendence-Related Terms

- **Transcendence (in AI context)**: The process or state where humanity integrates with or evolves beyond its biological form through AI, potentially merging consciousness, augmenting cognition, or creating hybrid entities.  
  *Relevance*: Core to the project, encompassing human-AI symbiosis or post-human futures.  
  *Source*: Synthesized from [Humanity's Capability of Transcendence through Artificial Intelligence](https://digitalcommons.csumb.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1532&context=caps_thes).

- **Human-AI Symbiosis**: A cooperative relationship where humans and AI enhance each other’s capabilities, often via augmentation technologies like brain-computer interfaces.  
  *Relevance*: A pathway to transcendence, impacting identity and capabilities.  
  *Source*: [Transcend: Unlocking Humanity in the Age of AI](https://www.amazon.com/Transcend-Faisal-Hoque/dp/1637589082).

- **Post-Humanism**: A future state where humans evolve beyond current biological and cognitive limits, potentially becoming hybrid or non-biological entities through AI integration.  
  *Relevance*: Represents an extreme outcome of transcending into AI.

## Societal and Ethical Terms

- **Value Alignment**: The process of ensuring AI systems’ goals and behaviors align with human ethical values and priorities.  
  *Relevance*: Critical to managing risks of AI-driven societal changes.  
  *Source*: [Proactively Protecting Against the Singularity: Ethical Decision Making in AI](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325980904_Proactively_Protecting_Against_the_Singularity_Ethical_Decision_Making_in_AI).

- **Existential Risk**: Threats to humanity’s survival or long-term potential, potentially caused by misaligned or uncontrollable AI systems.  
  *Relevance*: A key concern in transcendence scenarios involving ASI.  
  *Source*: [AI SINGULARITY: Navigating Implications and Framing Strategic Recommendations](https://dco.org/ai-singularity-navigating-implications-and-framing-strategic-recommendations/).

- **Social Stratification**: The division of society into hierarchical groups, potentially exacerbated by unequal access to AI augmentation or resources.  
  *Relevance*: Impacts social cohesion in an AI-transformed civilization.  
  *Source*: [The Impact of Generative Artificial Intelligence on Socioeconomic Inequalities](https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/3/6/pgae191/7689236).

## Technological and Economic Terms

- **Brain-Computer Interface (BCI)**: Technology enabling direct communication between the human brain and AI systems, potentially augmenting cognition or merging consciousness.  
  *Relevance*: A mechanism for transcendence, enabling human-AI integration.  
  *Source*: General knowledge, referenced in [Artificial Intelligence and Civilization Evolution](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/378567001_Artificial_Intelligence_AI_and_Civilization_Evolution_Technology_Strategy_and_Societal_Transformation).

- **Automation**: The use of AI to perform tasks without human intervention, from manual labor to complex decision-making.  
  *Relevance*: Drives economic and social disruption in AI-driven societies.  
  *Source*: [The Evidence So Far: What Research Reveals About AI's Real Impact](https://www.aei.org/technology-and-innovation/the-evidence-so-far-what-research-reveals-about-ais-real-impact-on-jobs-and-society/).
