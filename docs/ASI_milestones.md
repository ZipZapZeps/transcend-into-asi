## Critical Decision Points

### The Control Problem
The challenge of maintaining human agency and values as AI systems become more capable than their creators.

### The Alignment Problem  
Ensuring superintelligent systems pursue goals compatible with human flourishing and cosmic wellbeing.

### The Cooperation Problem
Coordinating between multiple advanced AI systems and preventing destructive competition.

### The Transcendence Choice
The decision point where humanity chooses integration with, enhancement by, or coexistence alongside ASI.

## Uncertainty Factors

### Timeline Variability
- **Hardware limitations**: Quantum computing breakthroughs could accelerate timelines
- **Theoretical breakthroughs**: Novel approaches to intelligence could dramatically change trajectories
- **Resource constraints**: Energy, materials, or economic limitations could slow progress
- **Regulatory responses**: Government policies could significantly impact development speed

### Alternative Pathways
