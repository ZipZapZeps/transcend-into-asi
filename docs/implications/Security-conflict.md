# Security and Conflict Implications of Transcending into AI

The deep integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into human society—potentially leading to a state where humanity "transcends" into ASI through cognitive augmentation, pervasive automation, or superintelligent systems—introduces significant security and conflict-related implications. This document explores how AI could reshape global security dynamics, influence conflict, and introduce new risks, drawing on the civilizational impacts discussed earlier. It also links to relevant resources and poses questions for further exploration.

## Overview
AI's transformative potential could amplify both cooperative and adversarial dynamics. As AI systems become more autonomous and powerful, they may redefine warfare, cybersecurity, and global stability. Key areas of concern include:
- **AI Arms Races**: Nations and non-state actors may compete to develop superior AI, escalating tensions.
- **Autonomous Weapons**: Lethal autonomous weapons (LAWs) could change the nature of conflict, raising ethical and control issues.
- **Cybersecurity Risks**: AI-driven cyberattacks could target critical infrastructure, economies, or societal trust.
- **Global Stability**: Uneven AI adoption could exacerbate geopolitical imbalances, fueling conflict or migration.
